# About
I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering from NMAM Institute of Technology in India in 2021. During my time there, l also completed an internship at Quality Theorem in Bengaluru, where I worked on developing web pages and connecting them to databases using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL technologies for an online examination system project.

Following my education, I joined Mercedes Benz Research and Development in India (MBRDI) as a Consultant from August 2021 to January 2024. In this role, I was heavily involved in DevOps practices, particularly in designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines using Maven, Sonar, Artifactory, Blackduck, Docker, and Kubernetes. I collaborated closely with various project teams to manage on-premises clusters, contribute to and maintain Flux-CD with Kustomize builds for automated deployments, and set up CaaS clusters with necessary components like Traefik controllers and certificate managers.

One of my key achievements during my time at Mercedes Benz was increasing code coverage by 60% for all microservice Java applications by optimizing JUnit test cases using the Spring Tool Suite. Additionally, I played a significant role in troubleshooting and resolving various runtime issues related to certificates, network configurations, and Kubernetes objects, ensuring minimal
downtime across all environments, including production.

I also took the initiative to mentor fellow team members and new hires in DevOps technologies, facilitating knowledge sharing and skill development within the team. Furthermore, I was responsible for managing the administration, security, and access control for GitHub code repositories and other essential tools like Blackduck, SonarQube, and Jenkins.

Outside of my professional experience, I have developed proficiency in a wide range of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bash, as well as various DevOps tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and Prometheus, among others.
